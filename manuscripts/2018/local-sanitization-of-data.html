<blockquote>
  <p>The widespread use of automated decision processes in many areas  of  our  society  raises  serious  ethical  issues  with  respect to the fairness of the process and the possible resulting discrimination. In this article, we propose a novel approach called GANSan whose objective is to prevent the possibility of discrimination based on a sensitive attribute by removing the attribute itself as well as the correlations with other attributes, thus protecting against direct as well as indirect discrimination. GANSan is inspired from the powerful framework of generative adversarial networks, which offers a flexible way to learn empirically the distribution of data. One of the strength of our approach is that it can be applied locally by an individual to sanitize his data before disclosing it similarly to randomized response. In addition, this sanitization is performed in the same space as the original data (thus preserving interpretability) by only modifying the other attributes as little as possible. Finally, experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach as well as the achievable trade-off between fairness and utility.</p>
